                    <p>When someone became sick and later comes out of disease, what worked for him- Medicine , Mind , Body or All ? What are the factors which works in treating a disease. Many a times even a sugar pills works and other times even most expensive drug or surgery failed. To know answers to these questions let us first try to understand what we are , who we are ?<br> <br>Are we a mere body made up of living and non-living things or we are beyond it. If someone believes that he or she had incurable diseases and can not be cured than no medicine or surgery works for them. Why reverse of it can not be right and one get healed by having positive assertion. What are factors which causing Healing. Healing is related to wholeness or Holy , which is eternal condition of each and every human being – whether realized or not realized. We are pure , sacred soul/ consciousness without any doubt, however our physical or mental condition is. Body and mind are works of nature and nature can only heal it.

                            <p>We are not this body or mind , nature is this body and mind and only nature can correct itself. Dis-ease is state of dis-comfort , failure of some part of nature or mis-interpretation of present situation. If we correct our concept , knows the reality half of problem is solved. If one organ of our body is in distress , it means we are going against nature of that organ. Start moving in proper direction things would start moving in better ways.

                    <p>Nature has immense potential, a seed contains another millions of seeds, millions of leaves, fruits, tress etc. A seed grows well when environment is positive and full of what it requires. A seed grows well in nutrient soil, in sun shine with air blowing around, so is human body. It nurtures well when loved, there are no negative emotions, no negative thoughts otherwise gulping of pills is not going to help. Love , care , positive emotions, positive thoughts , wonderful relations are necessity to nature to work for healing.</p>

                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>Human body get rejuvenated every 3rd day and one get all cells of body replaced in every eleven months than how come it is possible that disease can prolong for few years. It is only and only possible when there is something is beyond body, governing it. Nature works under this intelligence , Nature is only blue print of map, intelligence is doer. You correct your nature first , nature around you start working for you. It is very little known that how environment affect us , but reality is that environment is most important factor in knowing and controlling any dis-ease. Naturopathy says all dis-eases are one, their root cause is one and hence solution is one. This one can be Nature, so only nature can heal. When you take a sugar pills with firm belief it works and when you do not have faith on most expensive drug or surgery it fails. Nature works in co-ordination with consciousness. Nature is in fact nature of Love & God.
                        <br>
                        <br>Nature is neutral for all , does not favors any body , does not rejects any body it works in same manner for all. Nature is willing to heal all, care all, love all, its only depends upon on individual decision to know ones nature or take corrective measures. When a seed can grows to tall tree why not a small dis-ease be eradicated by nature , because only difference lies in intelligence. Seed does not have any doubt , it does not have any white coat wearing physician saying you had incurable dis-ease. All incurable diseases are cure able from “in” only. Nature is ready to bestows its care and love. Elements of nature –sand, water, air, sunshine , ether – all are living and no way any either of one is dead matter. Life can only comes from life only. <b> These living elements have immense power of healing. Only thing required is usage of these elements and a firm belief that nature can only heal !</b>
