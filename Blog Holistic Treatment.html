                    <p>Till few years back causes of various diseases were not known, after development of electron and higher resolution of microscopes few organisms were found responsible for some diseases. But still there are thousand of diseases causes of which not known and so called modern science is struggling to find reason behind these diseases. Chronicles and life style related diseases are under category where allopathic system failed completely. Unfortunately large chunk of present diseases –Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Cancer, Heart related, Auto Immune Diseases , Organ Failures , are related to this category. <br> <br>Traditional approach of allopathic medicines treats body on the basis of fact that body is made up of organs and treats each organ in isolation, but Human system is not a machine where parts are assembled to perform certain functions. Mind is supreme in human body and governs each and every cell by intelligence. Emotional is energy in motion and plays very significant role in human body.

                            <p>Spiritual growth is most ignored issue, Ayurveda focused on spiritual growth by controlling on dietary regime as well as changes in day to day life. If someone had been in stress through- out life and have developed the disease then how it is possible for elimination of diseases without removing root cause. One may taking drugs and medicines without removing root cause , even may go for repeated surgeries but hardly of any help. Problem/ Diseases keep repeating. </p>

                    <p>In a family all family members take same food and nutrients ,also ,outside home ,millions of people abuse their body by taking drugs, alcohol and junk food , why it happens that few developed life threatening disease. People responds differently to same stimuli depending upon their mind conditioning and result is that same medicine can- not work for two different people.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>From on-going discussions it is clear that to heal someone not only body or part of body is to be cured but body, mind, spirit and emotions all must be considered. It is important to know that human body is not just manifestation of intelligence but it is spiritual divine identity manifested here to experience physical world. As per Hinduism( and even by Budhism & Jainism ) this world is full of miseries and there is no single identity in the world who is free from sufferings.
                        <br>
                        <br> Holistic approach is integrated approach to come out of diseases , first step is acceptance of present condition and immediate second step is considering only oneself responsible for cause and trying to changes behavior pattern, emotional pattern and thinking pattern. Holistic treatment practitioners knows importance of morning walk, mild exercise , Pranayam & Yoga, Diet , Sleeping and wakening in time etc. There are researches available now where in short period of 1-2 months genes gets mutated , normalized after Pranayam & Yoga. There are study available where removal of anxiety and fear has removed stress and finally diseases.
                        <br>
                        <br> Every Human being is colony of 60 trillion cells , each cell is capable of doing everything and any activity even at micro level affect thousand of cells. Change in environment can cause removal of diseases. There is there that strange phenomenon happened ,called spontaneous remission, due to which thousand of people has come out from terminal end stage diseases to totally normally human being. Holistic treatment focuses on being positive and having faith in energy and various natural therapies which are small –small activities but involves large energies.
